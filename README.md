# Absorption Coefficient Calculator
A team project for the course "Python &amp; Akustik" at TU Berlin in the summer semester of 2023, imparted by Prof. Sarradj Ennes.

This software is a tool for calculating the absorption coefficient of different types of absorbers. The goal of this tool is to enable anyone to quickly calculate the absorption coefficient for different frequencies, either for one material or multilayered materials.
