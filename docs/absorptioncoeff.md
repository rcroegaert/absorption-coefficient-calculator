## About
This **class** calculates the absorption coefficient of different materials together.
It uses the **Transfer Matrix Method**, which treats a multilayered system as a series of matrices representing the different layers and interfaces. 
Each matrix describes how the wave propagates and interacts with the material at that particular interface. 
By multiplying these matrices together, the overall transfer matrix of the entire system can be obtained.
